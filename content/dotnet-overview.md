Microsoft describes it as

a **developer platform** that is:

# It's **free!**

It costs nothing to download *it* and create applications

# It's **cross-platform**

The .Net runtime is supported on Windows, MacOS, Linux, and other operating systems and devices

# It's **open source**

Source code for .Net system and tooling can be found in this Microsoft
