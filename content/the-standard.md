## I want to build...

a web application, I will use [.NET Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/)

a mobile Android application, I will use [Xamarin.Android](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/android/index)

a mobile iOS application, I will use [Xamarin.iOS](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/ios/index)

I can do this because all the above frameworks and runtimes adhere to the .NET Standard

![.NET Standard overview](/images/NET-standard.png)

The .NET Standard is a unified collection of specifications that are tailored to have cross-platform implementations as described above. This allows us to use the same stack to develop for many different operating systems and devices.
